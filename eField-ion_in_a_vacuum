# input file to track the motion of a free charged particle in an electric field
# code tracks the position and velocity of a charged particle
units metal     # distance in angstroms, energy in eV, time in ps, mass in grams/mole
dimension 3
processors * * *   # let LAMMPS assign this automatically
boundary p p p   # x y z boundary conditions.  P or S or F

atom_style charge   # each atom has a given charge

atom_modify sort 0 0
#      Sort the list of atoms in each processor's sub domain to speed up the simulation
#      This is turned off by using Nfreq = 0
#      syntax: atom_modify keyword values
#      atom_modify sort Nfreq binsize
#      Nfreq: sort atoms spatially every n timesteps
#      binsize: size of bins for spatial sorting (distance units)

#      syntax: region-ID style args keyword arg ...
#      block args: xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi, zlo zhi

create_box	1 myBox  
#      syntax: create_box N region-ID
#      N is number of atom types used in simulation
#      region-ID is ID of the region used in the simulation domain
#      "myBox" is just a name from the region command

create_atoms 1 single 0 0 0 
#      a single atom is positioned at coordinates x y x 
#      syntax: create_atoms type style args keyword values
#      type: type of atom, with value equalling 1 through N (from create_box command)
#      style: "box" or "region" or "single" or "random"
#         where 
#         "box", when used with "lattice" command, will fill the entire simulation box with 
#         particles on the lattice
#         "region" also fills a geometric volume with particles on the lattice
#         "single" lets you place an atom in a specific spot
#         "random" fills the system with particles at random positions.  particles will overlap
#         and an energy minimization is required to equilibrate the system

#   Electric field
fix 2 all efield 1e-9 0.0 0.0
#   applies an E-field in the x=+1 direction to all atoms.  name of the fix is 1.  
#      example in manual: fix kick external-field efield 1.0 0.0 0.0
#      with syntax: fix ID group-ID efield ex ey ez keyword value ...
#      where ID is a user-assigned name for the fix
#      where group-ID is the ID of the group of atoms the fix is applied to
#      efield is the name of this command
#      ex, ey, ez are E-field component values or variables (units of electric field)
#      keyword is an optionally specified region or energy
#      value is the corresponding value
